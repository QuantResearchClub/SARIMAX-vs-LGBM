### Eg 1.1 OTC Derivatives:
An over-the-counter derivative is any derivative security traded in the OTC marketplace. A derivative is a financial security whose value is determined by an underlying asset, such as a stock or a commodity. An owner of a derivative does not own the underlying asset, in derivatives such as commodity futures, it is possible to take delivery of the physical asset after the derivative contract expires.

Understanding of hidden risks through data analytics and modellling with as core objective proper integration in valuation, risk management and control processes from regulatory, institutional and trading desk perspective.

### Eg 1.2 
There is a need of quantitative finance:
A problem in Finance + Data + Mathematical & Statistical Models 

QF is the use of mathematical and statistical models to analyze.

- **Financial Engineering**: combines the mathematical theory of QF and implementation tools and methods of engineering, and the practice of programming to make price, trade, hedge or other investment decisions.
- **Computational Finance**: emphasizes practical numerical methods and focuses on techniques.
- **FinTech or TechFin**: is a new financial industry that applies new technology to improve financial activities, composed of one and more complementary financial services and provided as an end-to-end process via internet.
  - FinTech: financial services delivered (e.g. PayNow)
  - Techfin: A technology firm that finds a better access to deliver financial products as part of a broader offering of services. (e.g. Alipay)
Is Fintech QF 2.0? Nope.

### E.g. 1.3 Financial Derivatives Contracts (金融衍生品合约)
A derivative is a financial product whose value depends on the values of other more basic underlysing assets. 
#### 看涨期权（call option）称买进期权，
是指期权的购买者拥有在期权合约有效期内按执行价格买进一定数量标的物的权利。看涨期权是这样一种合约：它给合约持有者（即买方）按照约定的价格从对手手中购买特定数量之特定交易标的物的权利。
#### 看跌期权（Put Option）
是指期权的买方向期权的卖方支付一定数额的费用后，即拥有在期权合约的有效期内，按事先约定的价格向期权卖方卖出一定数量特定交易标的物的权利。

- Fair Premium:
- Eg.
  - Stock Price = 22, Option Price = ?;
  - Stock Price = 22, Option Price = 1 with probability p;
  - Stock Price = 18, Option Price = 0 with probability 1 - p;
  Suppose buy $/delta$ amount of shares in call option, 
- Reduce Risks:

Need to take into account many more aspects such as:
1. counterparty
2. dynamic volatility
3. heavy-tailed distribution

### Eg 1.4 Portfolio Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)
CVA is the difference between the risk-free and the value taking into account counterparty's default. It depends on:
- The possible exposure in the future.
- The probability of default of the counterparty.

Default Risks:
> 80 % of the default rates and illiquid.
Proposal by Regulators:
Cluster names with same region, sector and credit rating.
The proxy default rate for a cluster is calculated using mean od liquid rates that cluster.
The illiquid name is then assigned the proxy rate for the cluster to which it belongs.

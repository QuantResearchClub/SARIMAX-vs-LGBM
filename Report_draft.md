# Abstract
### 1.1. Our group target:
The topic of our group to investigate on the performance of predictions among different time-series models, we find there are not adequate research on this topic, hence introduces a comparison between them.

hence find a prediction model of the daily future log-return among shares in Nasdaq, through the positive and negative information of the predicted result, could assist judging the rightness of portofolio selections. In specific, these predictions are made by algorithms include ARIMA, LightGBM decision trees and MOV, we made comaprisions among these algorithms and hence provide suggestions of using them.

### 1.2. Our group suggestion:
We suggested by using a composition model of ARIMA and LGBM for limited-time period training of the shares predictions, for reasons we find: ...


### 1.3. Our group roles: (Draft, need edited)
#### Song Haoning
- Provide documents of the detailed indicators.
- Provide backtests among the models and optimize the parameters we used.

#### Zhang Dawei:
- Provide the basic scheme of the whole project.
- Provide the script for LGBM part
- Provide the script for MOV part.
- Provide the data displaying part.

#### Liu Cuiyuan:
- Integrate and test the code developed for the project.
- Provide the data procession part scripts, include downloading, sorting, cleaning and training.
- Provide the ARIMA part for predictions.

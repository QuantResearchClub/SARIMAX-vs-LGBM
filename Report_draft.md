# 1. Introduction

### 1.2. Our group target:
Our group target is to build a prediction model of the daily future log-return among shares in Nasdaq, through the positive and negative information of the prediction result, we can judge whether or not it is a right decision to keep or not keep one particular share in our portofolio hence making profits.
